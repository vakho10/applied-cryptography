Brief Describe of How TLS Provides Confidentiality and Integrity

Confidentiality:

1. It Uses symmetric encryption (e.g., AES) after handshake
2. Prevents eavesdropping on data exchanged
3. Keys exchanged securely using asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECDHE)

Integrity:

1. TLS uses Message Authentication Codes (MACs) or Authenticated Encryption (like GCM mode) to detect tampering
2. Handshake includes digital certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
