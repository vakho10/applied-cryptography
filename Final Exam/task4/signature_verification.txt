Signature Verification Process:

1. Digital Signature Creation:
   - Alice creates SHA-256 hash of the message
   - Encrypts the hash with her private key (creates signature)
   - Includes her certificate in the signed message

2. Verification Steps:
   a) Bob decrypts message with his private key
   b) Extracts Alice's certificate
   c) Validates certificate chain against trusted CA
   d) Extracts signature and decrypts with Alice's public key
   e) Computes hash of received message
   f) Compares computed hash with decrypted hash

3. Validation Outcomes:
   - Valid Signature: 
     * Certificate chain verifies to trusted CA
     * Hashes match â†’ proves authenticity and integrity
   - Invalid Signature: 
     * Certificate verification fails, OR
     * Hashes don't match

4. Security Guarantees:
   - Authentication: Verified via X.509 certificate chain
   - Integrity: Signed hash prevents tampering
   - Non-repudiation: Only Alice's private key could sign
   - Confidentiality: Only Bob's private key can decrypt
