In order to create a shared secret between two parties over an unsecure channel, Diffie-Hellman key exchange is typically utilized in 
secure communications. It plays a crucial role in creating ephemeral session keys that guarantee forward secrecy during the 
TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake. 
Additionally, it is a component of secure messaging protocols like the Signal Protocol, which enables end-to-end encryption in 
applications like Signal and WhatsApp.

Its significance comes from the fact that it enables two parties to decide on a secret key without ever sending it directly, 
making it impossible for eavesdroppers to figure out the key even if they manage to intercept all network traffic. 
In terms of contemporary internet security, this makes it essential for creating private and verified communication.
